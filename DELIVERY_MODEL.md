# Delivery Model — Google Workspace HIPAA Baseline

1. **Intake** — identify the Workspace domain, current sharing/security posture, and HIPAA/BAA expectations.
2. **Baseline** — apply / guide the core Workspace security and sharing settings appropriate for PHI.
3. **Evidence** — customer captures admin / audit exports in **their** tenant.
4. **Handoff** — Fedlin provides scope + evidence model for the customer's assessor/MSP.

**Note on automation:**  
Where customers use GitHub and allow OIDC-based delivery, we can store checks / policy descriptions in GitHub and run validations without exporting tenant data.
