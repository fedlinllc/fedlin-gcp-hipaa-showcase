We configure Google Workspace to **support HIPAA**: BAA in place and documented, core admin controls enforced, and a readiness summary you can share with stakeholders.  
> **Optional Phase 2:** Google Cloud **Security Command Center (Standard)** posture & documentation (separate scope).

---

## How it works

1. **Intake & access** â€” Align on scope and grant temporary admin (or run via guided screenshare). No PHI requested.  
2. **Apply guardrails** â€” Configure Workspace to support HIPAA: document BAA, enforce core controls.  
3. **Handoff** â€” Receive an executive summary and operator checklist. *(Phase 2: GCP SCC Standard available separately.)*
