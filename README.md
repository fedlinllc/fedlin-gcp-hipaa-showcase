## Always-visible compliance notes
1. **Org scope:** Google Cloud **Security Command Center (SCC) ‚Äì Standard** is **organization-scoped**; configuration applies tenant-wide.  
2. **Not legal advice:** This service provides technical controls and documentation; it is **not legal advice** or a certification.  
3. **Shared responsibility:** HIPAA compliance remains a **shared responsibility** between your organization and its vendors.  
4. **Access & PHI handling:** Temporary admin access is required; **no PHI is requested or handled** during onboarding or in public artifacts.  
5. **Evidence location:** Evidence remains **in your tenant**; any public examples are **redacted**.  
6. **BAAs:** **BAAs are between you and your vendors** (e.g., Google/others); Fedlin signs a BAA **only when contracted as a Business Associate**.
