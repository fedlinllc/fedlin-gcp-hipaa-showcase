We configure Google Workspace to **support HIPAA**: BAA in place and documented, core admin controls enforced, and a readiness summary you can share with stakeholders.  
> **Optional Phase 2:** Google Cloud **Security Command Center (Standard)** posture & documentation (offered separately).

## How it works

1. **Intake & access** — We align on scope and get temporary admin (or run via guided screenshare). No PHI requested.
2. **Apply guardrails** — We configure Google Workspace to support HIPAA: BAA documented, core controls enforced.
3. **Handoff** — You get an executive summary and an operator checklist. Phase 2 (GCP SCC Standard) available separately.

## Outcomes
