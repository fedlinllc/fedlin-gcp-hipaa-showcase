_HIPAA-aligned Google Workspace configuration with documented controls. Public brief â€” no raw evidence._

We configure Google Workspace to **support HIPAA**: BAA in place and documented, core admin controls enforced, and a readiness summary you can share with stakeholders.  
> **Optional Phase 2:** Google Cloud **Security Command Center (Standard)** posture & documentation (separate scope).

---

## How it works

1. **Intake & access** â€” Align on scope and grant temporary admin (or run via guided screenshare). No PHI requested.  
2. **Apply guardrails** â€” Configure Workspace to support HIPAA: document BAA, enforce core controls.  
3. **Handoff** â€” Receive an executive summary and operator checklist. *(Phase 2: GCP SCC Standard available separately.)*

---

## What you get

- âœ… **BAA documented**
- âœ… **Workspace controls enforced**
- âœ… **Readiness summary delivered**

**Access & Admin Controls:** We harden sign-in and administrator access to HIPAA-appropriate standards (strong verification, least-privilege), without publishing step-by-step guides.

**Data Protection & Sharing:** We set protective Workspace defaults for Gmail and Drive to reduce accidental exposure and align external sharing with HIPAA expectations.

**Retention & eDiscovery (add-on):** When requested, we prepare Workspace for HIPAA-appropriate retention and basic eDiscovery readiness using Google Vault features available in your plan.

**Delivery & Scope:** Work is typically completed within **3 business days after access** for a single Google Workspace tenant (most baselines fit **â‰¤100 users**; larger environments are scoped separately).

_Public proof style:_ statements only â€” **no screenshots/how-tos/raw logs/IDs** in this showcase.  
For deeper mapping, see **EVIDENCE_TABLE.md** (abstract) and **README_AUDIT_NOTES.md** (redacted notes).

## Prereqs

- Google Workspace tenant with temporary **Super Admin** (or guided screenshare)  
- Single or multi-domain welcome; weâ€™ll scope appropriately  
- No special network changes required

---

## Scope & Assumptions

- Single Google Workspace tenant; most baselines fit **â‰¤100 users** (larger environments are scoped separately).
- We configure controls to **support HIPAA**; this is not a full HIPAA risk analysis or compliance program.
- Only features available in your current Workspace SKUs are configured (e.g., Vault, DLP, context-aware access if licensed).
- Evidence remains in your tenant; the public repo is a conservative brief without screenshots or raw logs.

**Change Order:** If discovery reveals additional tenants, complex multi-domain routing, unlicensed features required, or access delays that materially extend effort, weâ€™ll document blockers and provide a revised estimate before proceeding.

- **Licensing note:** Some controls (e.g., Google Vault retention/eDiscovery, advanced DLP, context-aware access) require specific Workspace SKUs. We configure what your current licenses support and flag gaps.

---

## Whatâ€™s not included

- A full HIPAA risk analysis, policy/training program, or legal advice
- Multi-tenant or multi-brand rollouts (scoped separately)
- Third-party app risk reviews beyond obvious high-risk items
- Detailed how-to guides, screenshots, or raw logs (evidence stays in your tenant)
